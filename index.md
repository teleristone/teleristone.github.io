I am a recent graduate from Lancaster University with a degree in Zoology (with Placement Year) BSc. I am currently doing an [internship with N8 CIR](https://n8cir.org.uk/themes/internships/internships-2025/lancaster/).

I did my placement at [Cardiff University Otter Project](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/otter-project)

*I am making this webpage as part of my internship, so is currently a work in progress as I learn new skills*
